  # Safety net: strip com.apple.quarantine before the app is ever launched.
  # For a properly notarized+stapled release this is a harmless no-op (Gatekeeper
  # trusts the stapled ticket). It only matters for an ad-hoc fallback build,
  # where launching while quarantined would make Gatekeeper cache a reject by
  # cdhash and the kernel SIGKILL the app thereafter. `xattr -dr` does not exist
  # on macOS 26, so recurse with find; `|| true` tolerates a missing attribute.
